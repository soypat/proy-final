abstract = {This paper presents a simple and useful modeling method to acquire a dynamics model of an aerial vehicle containing unknown parameters using mechanism modeling, and then to design different identification experiments to identify the parameters based on the sources and features of its unknown parameters. Based on the mathematical model of the aerial vehicle acquired by modeling and identification, a design for the structural parameters of the attitude control system is carried out, and the results of the attitude control flaps are verified by simulation experiments and flight tests of the aerial vehicle. Results of the mathematical simulation and flight tests show that the mathematical model acquired using parameter identification is comparatively accurate and of clear mechanics, and can be used as the reference and basis for the structural design.}

abstract = {This paper presents a study of the runtime, memory usage and energy consumption of twenty seven well-known software languages. We monitor the performance of such languages using ten different programming problems, expressed in each of the languages. Our results show interesting findings, such as, slower/faster languages consuming less/more energy, and how memory usage influences energy consumption. Finally, we show how to use our results to provide software engineers support to decide which language to use when energy efficiency is a concern.},
